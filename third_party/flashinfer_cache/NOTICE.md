# FlashInfer mixed FP8 cache tile patch

Upstream: flashinfer-ai/flashinfer, revision 69ff11fc4954396d98326656dc85debd2223f637 (Apache-2.0).
HYLE applies the exact edits in patches.json only to a build-local verified copy.
The shared K row for FP8 Dqk64/Dv128 uses 128 bytes with a zero upper half; public/global
cache rows and the QK reduction remain 64 elements. Both paged/ragged producers, repack
source stride and dispatcher shared-memory accounting follow that physical tile row.
No complete cache history is padded or dequantized. Other native domains are unchanged.
The immutable upstream source cache is never modified. Original copyright/license apply.

The private encoded-cache adapter also permits a final merge callback and an optional
scale epilogue in the original persistent merge. FP32 partials and accumulation remain
unchanged; scaling precedes the sole final cast, including a single partial. Default
upstream routes retain their original output semantics. No public HYLE API is added.
